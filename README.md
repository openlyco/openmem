# OpenMem

Project-level memory system for AI-powered development.

## Why OpenMem?

**The Problem We Solved**

While using AI-powered development tools like OpenClaw, we experienced a critical issue: **important conversations and decisions were frequently lost**. The trigger-based memory system missed crucial context daily - technical decisions, problem-solving insights, and creative breakthroughs disappeared into the void.

**Our Development Environment Has Evolved**

The IDE is no longer just a code editor. It's become our **primary workspace** where we:
- Discuss architecture with AI
- Debug complex problems  
- Capture fleeting insights
- Make critical technical decisions

Only polished outcomes become documentation (MD/Word/PDF). But the **golden moments** - the sparks of insight during live problem-solving - deserve to be preserved too.

**Our Solution: Full Recording + Smart Organization**

Instead of relying on imperfect triggers, we record **everything** and organize intelligently. This approach:
- ✅ Never misses important context
- ✅ Captures the complete thinking process
- ✅ Turns conversations into actionable knowledge
- ✅ Works across all development scenarios

**Four Usage Scenarios**

1. **IDE Integration** (Trae / VS Code) - Your daily driver
2. **Code Editor** - Lightweight editing sessions  
3. **CLI Tools** - Command-line development
4. **AI Assistant** (OpenClaw) - Enhanced memory for your AI partner

**Why We Built This**

We're developers who faced the same pain point. After replacing our own OpenClaw memory with this system and seeing dramatic improvements, we knew we had to share it.

**Learn from OpenClaw, Evolve Beyond**

OpenClaw showed us the way. We're continuing that evolution - breaking context limitations, preserving knowledge, and making every conversation count.

## Installation

```bash
pip install openmem
```

Or development mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### Initialize

```bash
# Project-level Memory
memory init

# Global Memory (shared across projects)
memory init --global

# Select template
memory init --template=standard
memory init --template=full

# Non-interactive mode
memory init -y
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Add memory
memory add "Use JWT for authentication" --type decision --tags auth,security

# Search
memory search auth
memory search auth --scope both

# List
memory list --type decision

# Status
memory status
memory status -v
```

### Python API

```python
from memory import MemoryManager

# Auto-select (project first)
memory = MemoryManager()

# Add memory
memory_id = memory.add(
    content="Use JWT for authentication",
    type="decision",
    tags=["auth", "security"]
)

# Search
results = memory.search("auth", scope="both")

# List
memories = memory.list(type="decision")

memory.close()
```
